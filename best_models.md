## 📌 **Tips for Best Use**

✅ For **Networking tasks**: pair your LLM with your actual configs & docs using **RAG** → even open models can answer advanced infra Q&A when you connect them to your knowledge base.

✅ For **Coding tasks**: GPT-4 is still #1 for complex bugs & integration code.

✅ For **Math & Reasoning**: chain-of-thought prompting improves any model’s performance.

✅ For **Docs & Summaries**: Claude 3 and GPT-4 are both excellent.
